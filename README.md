# Advent of Code 2017

These are just my puzzle solutions for the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

Most likely it will be a mix of various languages, patterns and styles - mostly to try new stuff or because I'm lazy for a particular day :-)

| Day    | Technology       | Result  |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| 1      | Java / Maven     | **      |
| 2      | Java / Maven     | **      |
| 3      | JavaScript / npm | *       |
| 4      | Java / Maven     | **      |
| 5      | JavaScript / npm | **      |
